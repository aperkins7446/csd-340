                <div class="card-content">
                    One of my favorite hobbies is baking! It brings me tons of joy because it's generally an instant gratification type project, so you have something to show for your efforts by the end of the day.
                    I also love baking because it brings others joy too- when you see someone smiling after taking a bite of something you made, it truly makes the time and effort worth it.

                <div class="card-content">
                    I'm forever a geek at heart, I actually managed a video game store for 10 years! Now, I've hit a point where I'm lucky if there is enough time for causal gaming.
                    I just adore the game Animal Crossing New Horizons- it was the first game I got my daughter excited about, and we spent a lot of time bonding just by playing it together.

                    My co-workers joke that I'm the pod cast queen, and they're probably right. While at work, I almost always have an earbud in with a good pod casts. 
                    I think they're a brilliant way to share stories, get information out, and spark discussion. 
                    There are some I listen to for entertainment, like the Dr. Death series, and others I've listened to that have really helped my personal development.

                    Specialty Retail Management
                </div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    I spent a decade in specialty retail management for a certain popular video game chain store. 
                    There were times when it was so much fun; I truly had a blast getting to spend my days geeking out with customers over games, my stores always had the best mid-night release parties, and I thought I was going to spend my entire adult life with that company.
                    Then came what I'll refer to as the dark times for the company where the sales of subscriptions and pre-orders became more important than helping a customer find something that would make them happy immediately, and creating lasting bonds.

                    Paralegal Specializing in Personal Injury Litigation

                <div class="card-content">
                    I was a paralegal who specialized in personal injury litigation. That was a huge learning experience! I was taken on by a law firm fresh after graduation, and I had no idea how much I didn't know.
                    I had some exceptional supervisors who were so happy to show me the ropes, and they made a job really fulfilling. It was always a great day at the office when we won for our client, and knew we had done everything possible to make them whole.

                    This takes us to my current job: I am a Systems Operation Technician supporting forty plus schools, responsible for our district's state reporting. 
                    I support our School Information System by helping with the roll out of new processes, support for our end users, and ensuring the information in our S.I.S. is accurately reported to the state, which has a huge impact on our funding.
                    Most days, I really enjoy what I do, but I always enjoy the people I work with. My aspiration is to be the first Operations Team to transition to a Developer role!
